# Solution

This solution is a simple web application that allows users to view and edit a list of products. The solution is composed of two projects:

- **Backend**: A .NET 6 Web API project that exposes a RESTful API to manage products.
- **Frontend**: An Angular 16.2.0 project that provides a user interface to interact with the backend.
